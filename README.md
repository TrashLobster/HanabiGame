Rules to Hanabi: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/hanabi/game-rules.php

Backend: Java

The goal is to create the basic operations using java 

Implementing AI player is doable within the timeframe and knowledge base. This project should have both player class and AI players.

Optional: and then implement it so that it can run on a browser as a multiplayer experience. The online game will run on a room-based engagement.

Disclaimer: This project is not designed for profit - it is purely a learning experience and to be a part of my development portfolio in the future. Hanabi was designed by Antoine Bauza and published by R&R Games, Cocktail games and Abacus Spiele.

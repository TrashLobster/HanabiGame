# HanabiGame
Create a console version of Hanabi to be played offline and on one computer

Rules to Hanabi: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/hanabi/game-rules.php

Language: Java

Development time: 10 hrs (inlcuding bug fix)

The goal is to practise game logic and OOP.

Disclaimer: This project is not designed for profit - it is purely a learning experience and to be a part of my development portfolio in the future. Hanabi was designed by Antoine Bauza and published by R&R Games, Cocktail games and Abacus Spiele. 

Limitations: The basic game functions are present, but some of the features that have not been implemented include:
  - The ability to use cancel as an input and return to the previous option whenever you are asked for a command (currently only implemented for the give hint command).
  - A graphical interface would serve this game a lot better
